## Project Overview

**CSS Atlas** is a full-stack scholar-management platform for a university program. It tracks scholar attendance, mentorship activity, form submissions, and weekly performance data.

## Core Request Flow

```
Browser
  └─ Frontend (Next.js Server Component or Client fetch)
       ├─ lib/server/api-client.ts  →  extracts JWT from cookies
       └─ fetch() to backend /api/*
            └─ Backend (Express)
                 ├─ requireAuth middleware  →  validates JWT via Supabase
                 ├─ runWithToken()          →  binds JWT to AsyncLocalStorage
                 ├─ Controller             →  validates inputs, calls services
                 └─ Service               →  queries Supabase (RLS applied)
```

---

## Authentication Model

- Users authenticate via Supabase in the frontend.
- The JWT is stored in cookies by `@supabase/ssr`.
- For backend calls, `frontend/lib/server/api-client.ts` reads the JWT from cookies and attaches it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- Backend middleware (`requireAuth`, `requireTeamLeaderOrAbove`, `requireDeveloper`) verifies the JWT and loads the user profile.
- Services call `getSupabaseClient()` which reads the JWT from `AsyncLocalStorage` — this means **all Supabase queries in the backend are automatically RLS-scoped to the authenticated user**.

---

## Role Hierarchy

```
null (basic user / scholar)
  └─ team_leader
       └─ developer
```

Roles are stored in `profiles.app_role` (or `user_roster.app_role`).

## Environment Variables

### Backend (`.env` in `backend/`)
| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Yes | Supabase project URL |
| `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Yes | Supabase anon/publishable key |
| `PORT` | No | Server port (default: `3001`) |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | No | Comma-separated allowed origins. Default in `app.ts` is `http://localhost:3002`; Docker Compose defaults to `http://localhost:3000`. **Must match the frontend URL.** |

### Frontend (`.env.local` in `frontend/`)
| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Yes | Supabase project URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Yes | Supabase anon/publishable key |
| `BACKEND_URL` | No | Server-side backend URL (default: auto-detected from `VERCEL_URL` → `/_/backend`, else `http://localhost:3001`) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` | No | Browser-side backend URL (default: `http://localhost:3001`; set in Docker/production builds) |

## Local Development

**New developers:** follow [Onboarding — Day 0 setup](onboarding/day-0-setup.md) (preferred: `./scripts/dev.sh --install`; Windows: `.\scripts\dev.ps1 -Install`).

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install --prefix backend
npm install --prefix frontend
npm install --prefix shared

# Build shared library (must come first)
npm run build --prefix shared

# Start backend
npm run dev --prefix backend    # port 3001

# Start frontend
npm run dev --prefix frontend   # port 3000
```

## Campus Week System

The app uses a **campus week** numbering system (not ISO weeks), defined in `shared/time-config.ts`. Week 1 starts on a configurable `FALL_SEMESTER_FIRST_DAY`. Most data queries take a `weekNum` parameter (integer).

This shared campus calendar is the **server-owned time frame** — use it for week bounds, navigation, and queries. Prefer it over `GET /api/auth/semester` / `GET /api/auth/active-semester` (and `getActiveSemester`), which should be used sparingly: when the server-owned time frame does not make sense (e.g. historical data, or the collection year has not started yet), or when a Supabase `semesters` row is required.

| **WHAF** | Weekly Hours Activity Form |
| **WPL** | Weekly Performance Log |
| **Memo** | Weekly summary report aggregating all activity data |

## Standards Across the Whole Codebase

1. **TypeScript everywhere** — no plain `.js` source files in `backend/src/`, `shared/`, or `frontend/` (except compiled output in `dist/`).
2. **Imports use `.js` extension** in backend source — required for Node ESM compatibility even though files are `.ts`.
3. **Shared code lives in `shared/`** — anything used by both backend and frontend must go there, never duplicated.
4. **No Supabase in `shared/`** — shared utilities must be pure TypeScript with no server-side dependencies.
5. **Services own all Supabase access** — controllers must not import from `@supabase/supabase-js` directly.
6. **API responses wrap data** — all backend routes return `{ data: ... }` or `{ error: "..." }`.
7. **No logic in routes** — routes only wire middleware → controller. All business logic is in services.
8. **`server-only` guard** in any frontend module that must not run on the client.
9. **Published docs site** — the human-facing handbook is on GitHub Pages (MkDocs). Keep pages **concise at the top** (Purpose, Navigation, Files) and put deep detail / generated API indexes at the **bottom**. In-site navigation must stay under `docs/`; use GitHub blob links for source code.

### Docs depth

- **Handbook vs reference** — `docs/dev/` is the human handbook (standards, placement, ops). Symbol catalogs are generated TypeDoc under [`docs/reference/`](../reference/README.md); link there instead of inventing leaf mirrors.
- **New README only for a Standards boundary** — add a `docs/dev/**/README.md` when a directory has rules that parent hubs cannot own, not merely because a source folder exists.
- **Missing leaf READMEs are expected** — walk up to the nearest parent hub; that hub’s Purpose / Standards are authoritative.
- **Architecture narrative** — humans: this page; agents: [`docs/agents/codebase-notes.md`](../agents/codebase-notes.md). Other handbook pages **link**, do not retell request flow / auth / roles.

## Developer test profiles

Developers (`app_role === developer`) can switch to curated **test personas** stored in `public.dev_test_profiles` (cloud Supabase). This emulates another user's roles and `roster_uid` for read-only debugging without their credentials.

- **My profile** — default; full write access as the developer.
- **Acting as test profile** — true API mutations blocked via a **denylist** in `rejectWritesWhenActing` (not all POSTs); `/api/dev/*` stays writable. See [`docs/dev/backend/src/middleware/README.md`](backend/src/middleware/README.md).
- **Security** — clients send only `dev_test_profiles.id` (cookie → `X-Dev-Active-Profile` header); server resolves `roster_uid` from DB.

Setup: [`docs/dev/supabase/README.md`](supabase/README.md). CI: [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](https://github.com/College-Success-Scholars/css-atlas-v2/blob/develop/.github/workflows/ci.yml).
