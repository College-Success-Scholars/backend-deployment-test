## Purpose

Shell scripts for deployment validation and operational tasks. These run outside of Node — they use `curl` and standard Unix tools to smoke-test a live deployment. Hosted topology and CI wiring: [Deployment](../deployment/README.md).

## Files

| `dev.ps1` | [source](https://github.com/College-Success-Scholars/css-atlas-v2/blob/develop/scripts/dev.ps1) | Windows PowerShell mirror of `dev.sh` |
| `smoke-test.sh` | [source](https://github.com/College-Success-Scholars/css-atlas-v2/blob/develop/scripts/smoke-test.sh) | Deployment health-check: tests health endpoint, auth gating, and CORS headers |
| `alert.sh` | [source](https://github.com/College-Success-Scholars/css-atlas-v2/blob/develop/scripts/alert.sh) | Opens an architectural alert as a GitHub Issue (`architecture-alert`). Requires `gh` auth — no markdown fallback |
| `resolve-alert.sh` | [source](https://github.com/College-Success-Scholars/css-atlas-v2/blob/develop/scripts/resolve-alert.sh) | Resolves an alert by issue number: logs session via `log-agent-session.sh`, then closes the issue (or comments if already closed) |
| `ensure-issue-labels.sh` | [source](https://github.com/College-Success-Scholars/css-atlas-v2/blob/develop/scripts/ensure-issue-labels.sh) | Idempotently creates triage / type / `architecture-alert` labels (`gh` required) |
| `migrate-alerts-to-issues.sh` | [source](https://github.com/College-Success-Scholars/css-atlas-v2/blob/develop/scripts/migrate-alerts-to-issues.sh) | One-shot: migrate legacy `docs/agents/alerts/*.md` files to GitHub Issues, then delete those files |
| `log-agent-session.sh` | [source](https://github.com/College-Success-Scholars/css-atlas-v2/blob/develop/scripts/log-agent-session.sh) | Records an agent/AI session to `docs/agents/logs/`: who ran it, raw user prompt, stated purpose, agent response summary, and changed files |
| `configure-supabase-confirm-email-template.sh` | [source](https://github.com/College-Success-Scholars/css-atlas-v2/blob/develop/scripts/configure-supabase-confirm-email-template.sh) | Patches Supabase **Confirm signup** email template so links use `token_hash` + `type` for `/auth/confirm` |
| `ingest-user-roster.sh` | [source](https://github.com/College-Success-Scholars/css-atlas-v2/blob/develop/scripts/ingest-user-roster.sh) | Ops: stream a roster CSV into `public.user_roster` (service role prompted interactively; no PII dumps to disk) |

## Standards

- **Smoke tests only** — integration and unit tests live in `backend/src/tests/` and `frontend/` respectively.
- **Use `BASE_URL` env var** — scripts must be configurable for different environments (local, staging, production).
- **Exit codes matter** — scripts must exit with `0` on success and `1` on failure so CI can detect them.
- **No secrets in scripts** — never hardcode credentials or tokens.

---

## Usage

### `dev.sh` / `dev.ps1`

Starts the local full-stack loop: builds `shared/`, optionally watches it, then runs backend (`:3001`) and frontend (`:3000`) in one process group (Ctrl+C stops all).

**Before you run it**, create env files from the examples — the script exits with an error if they are missing:

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.local
# then edit both with real Supabase URL/key values
```

Day 0 walkthrough (order matters): [Onboarding — Day 0 setup](../onboarding/day-0-setup.md).

```bash
# Start local full-stack dev (frontend :3000, backend :3001)
./scripts/dev.sh
./scripts/dev.sh --install     # npm install in shared, backend, frontend first
./scripts/dev.sh --no-watch    # build shared once; skip tsc --watch

# Windows PowerShell (same behavior)
.\scripts\dev.ps1
.\scripts\dev.ps1 -Install
.\scripts\dev.ps1 -NoWatch

```

### `ingest-user-roster.sh`

Ops script for bulk-loading a sheet export into `public.user_roster`. Companion parser: [`scripts/ingest-user-roster.py`](https://github.com/College-Success-Scholars/css-atlas-v2/blob/develop/scripts/ingest-user-roster.py).

**Sensitivity**

- Treat the CSV as PII. The script reads it from the path you pass and POSTs mapped rows to Supabase; it does **not** write transformed CSV/JSON/report files.
- Secure or delete the source CSV yourself after the run.
- Insert-only (re-runs can duplicate on email). Non-9-digit UIDs are stored as `NULL`.

**Credentials**

| Credential | Source |
|------------|--------|
| Supabase URL | `SUPABASE_URL` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` in the current shell, or URL-only from `backend/.env` |
| Service role | Interactive hidden prompt (or `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` already exported in **this** shell). Never loaded from project `.env` / `.env.local`, and not documented in `.env.example` |

`--dry-run` skips the prompt and does not POST. Stdout includes TSV reports for bad university emails (with contact fields) and null UIDs.
